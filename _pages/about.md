I am a second-year Ph.D. student in computer science at National University of Singapore. I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), where I also completed my master‚Äôs studies. Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Software Engineering from Wuhan University supervised by [Prof. Tieyun Qian](https://www.aminer.cn/profile/tieyun-qian/53f47bdfdabfaee4dc89fe30).

I'm seeking a **summer research internship for 2025** and would welcome any information about available opportunities.

Research
======
My current research mainly focus on **large-scale deep learning optimization**, **efficient machine learning** and **video generation**. I'm also eager to discuss intriguing research concepts and open to academic partnerships. If you're interested in collaboration, feel free to reach out via email.
